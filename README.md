# Final-project
# Portable Soil Monitor

## Project Overview
The Portable Soil Monitor is a device designed for real-time monitoring of soil moisture. It uses a soil moisture sensor to collect data, analyzes trends with a machine learning algorithm, and predicts the next watering time to help users scientifically manage their plants.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of soil moisture levels.
- Machine learning-based trend analysis to predict dryness for the next 1â€“2 days.
- Stepper motor-driven needle to display soil moisture status.
- LED indicators to provide watering reminders.
- Touch-sensitive button for manual data refresh.
- Solar-powered with backup lithium battery for continuous operation.
